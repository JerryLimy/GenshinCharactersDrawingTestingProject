# Genshin Characters Drawing Testing Project
---------------------------------------------
This program can be used as a draw character cards simulator from a video game called Genshin Impact. This program can simulate drawing cards from the pool with different possibilities (a rarity) for each character. Users can test their luck before drawing their character cards in the real game. It would be beneficial for the user to test their luck(and to not put so much money in it if they have a bad luck day).
## How to import

2. Put the Genshin.cvs in the same folder as the files above.
3. Click run on genshin.py to run the simulator.
