# Genshin Characters Drawing Testing Project
---------------------------------------------
This program can be used as a draw character cards simulator from a video game called Genshin Impact. This program can simulate drawing cards from the pool with different possibilities (a rarity) for each character. This program uses linked lists to transfer the names of the characters, elements of the characters, and the rarity of the characters randomly from the csv list. Users can test their luck before drawing their character cards in the real game. It would be beneficial for the user to test their luck(and to not put so much money in it if they have a bad luck day).
## How to import this simulator into your device:
1. Download all the files above and ensure you have a Python IDE.
2. Put the genshin.csv in the same folder as the files above.
3. Click run on Genshin.py to run the simulator.
